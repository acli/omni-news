If you’ve tried `omni-news --languages`,
you might be wondering what the codes in the “Days” column mean.
These are days of the week in Waterloo form.

I no longer feel any connection to the University of Waterloo, 
but I still use their system of 1-letter codes because it’s ultra compact
and once you learn how to read it, it’s easy to understand
and it’s unambiguous.

The codes are as follows:
- M = Monday
- T = Tuesday
- W = Wednesday
- R = Thursday
- F = Friday
- S = Saturday
- U = Sunday

Similar codes are in common use, of course —
except Thursday is usually Th, which makes the code variable-width,
and Sunday would often be S, which makes it ambiguous.
