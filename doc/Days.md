Days of the week (from `omni-news --languages`) are encoded in Waterloo form.
I no longer feel any connection to the University of Waterloo, 
but I still use their codes because it’s compact
and once you learn how to read it, it’s easy to understand.

The codes are as follows:
- M = Monday
- T = Tuesday
- W = Wednesday
- R = Thursday
- F = Friday
- S = Saturday
- U = Sunday
